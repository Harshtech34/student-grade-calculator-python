# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Student Grade Calculator is a Python-based console application that calculates a student's grade based on marks entered by the user.  
The program validates input, assigns grades using conditional statements, and displays encouraging messages for students.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, loops, input validation, and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Accept student name and marks as input
- Validate marks within the range of 0 to 100
- Assign grades using if-elif-else logic
- Display encouraging messages for each grade
- Allow calculation for multiple students
- Follow clean and modular coding practices

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Functions
- While Loop
- If-Elif-Else Statements
- Input Validation

## 🧠 Grading Logic
| Marks Range | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 90 – 100   | A |
| 80 – 89    | B |
| 70 – 79    | C |
| 60 – 69    | D |
| 0 – 59     | F |
